# Revised Explore Room Perimeter Challenge Walkthrough with Backward Movement Task

This walkthrough guides you through programming a robot to navigate the perimeter of a room and then complete its path by moving backward.

## Steps 1 to 4:
(These steps involve navigating the perimeter using sensor feedback and logical decision-making, as detailed in the previous walkthrough.)

## Conclusion and New Task

After navigating the room's perimeter, the next task is to have the robot move backward, demonstrating its ability to reverse.

### Simple Task: Complete Movement by Moving Backwards

**Objective:** Instruct the robot to move backward for a specified duration after completing its perimeter exploration.

**Instructions:**
1. After the robot finishes its perimeter navigation, add a command for it to move backward.
2. Set a duration for the backward movement.
3. Test the program to ensure the robot moves backward correctly after its perimeter navigation.

This task demonstrates the robot's versatile movement capabilities, highlighting its ability to execute precise maneuvers in multiple directions.
