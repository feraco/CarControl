**Let's talk about how this small car is controlled using Arduino!** 🏎️

1. **Including the Car Control Library**
    ```cpp
    #include "CarControl.h"
    ```
    This line is like telling the Arduino, "Hey, we're going to need the set of instructions you have for controlling the car!" 📜

2. **Setting Up the Car**
    ```cpp
    CarControl car(5, 6, 7, 8, 3, 2);
    ```
    Here, we're creating our car and telling the Arduino which pins are connected to the car's motors. 🎛️

3. **The Setup Function**
    ```cpp
    void setup() {
      car.setup();  // Initialize the car
    }
    ```
    This function is called once when the Arduino first starts up. It's like the car is waking up and getting ready for a drive! 🛌➡️🚗

4. **The Loop Function - Where the Magic Happens!**
    ```cpp
    void loop() {
      int speed = 255;  // Fastest speed!
      
      car.moveForward(speed, 2000);  // Zoom forward
      delay(1000);  // Wait for 1 second
      
      car.moveBackward(speed, 2000);  // Zoom backward
      delay(1000);  // Wait for 1 second
      
      car.turnLeft(speed, 2000);  // Turn left
      delay(1000);  // Wait for 1 second
      
      car.turnRight(speed, 2000);  // Turn right
      delay(1000);  // Wait for 1 second
      
      car.turnAround();  // Do a 180!
      delay(1000);  // Wait for 1 second
    }
    ```
    In this part, we're telling the car exactly what to do! We set a speed, then we have a series of commands telling the car to move forward, backward, turn left, turn right, and do a 180-degree turn, with short breaks in between each action. It's like a dance routine for the car! 💃🕺🚗

And that's it! Now you know how this program makes the car move around. 😊
